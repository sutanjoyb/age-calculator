## 🧠 How the Age Calculation Works

The application uses JavaScript’s built-in `Date` object:

1. Capture the user’s date of birth.  
2. Get the current system date.  
3. Subtract birth year from current year.  
4. Adjust months and days if the birthday hasn’t occurred yet this year.  
5. Display the final age result dynamically on the page.  

The logic ensures accurate calculation including month and day adjustments.
